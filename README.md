# AutoArt
Platform for Autogenerating Unique and Meaningful Digital Artwork   

This JAR uses a set of answers to these questions (link here) to generate a digital painting. It displays the image on the screen and also saves a PNG file in the active directory.

# How to Use
`java -jar AutoArt.jar <answer-txt-file> <canvas-width> <canvas-height>`    
    
The answer file must be formatted with all answers sequential on the first line:   
`aaabcbcbbaba`   
You must provide an answer file.    

`canvas-width` and `canvas-height` are optional and both default to 720px.
